    "\n",
    "### JSON for Configuration Flexibility: \n",
    "JSON files must be utilised to enable flexible configuration of SNN network parameters, storing crucial details such as layer sizes, learning rates, and hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HDF5 Storage for Encoded Signal:  \n",
    "Separate HDF5 files must be implemented to store the encoded signal before and after exposure to noise. The structure, datasets, and relevant metadata must be clearly documented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NPY Storage for SNN Weights: \n",
    "SNN weights must be stored in an NPY file, including weights for each network layer. Clear explanations and comments within the Jupyter Notebook regarding the organisation and structure of the NPY file are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AI Ethics Integration: \n",
    "AI ethics by design principles must be integrated into the SNN implementation. Implement steps to identify and mitigate algorithmic biases. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Spiking Records and Multimeters Integration:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Utilise spiking records and multimeters within the SNN architecture to record spike events and measure action potentials of decoding neurons.\n",
    "    Use spike recorders, capturing temporal patterns and relevant information during the encoding, decoding, and learning processes.\n",
    "    Use multimeters to measure the action potentials of decoding neurons, providing valuable insights into the dynamics and responsiveness of the network.\n",
    "    Integrate visualisations or plots within the Jupyter Notebook to showcase the recorded spiking events and action potentials, aiding in a comprehensive analysis of the SNN's behaviour and performance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Intercalated Training and Testing with Synaptic Switching:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Implement an intercalated training approach where supervised learning is used for a specified number of epochs, followed by testing using static synapses for a single epoch.\n",
    "    During training epochs, utilise supervised learning to enhance the SNN's performance and optimise decoding capabilities.\n",
    "    Implement a mechanism to switch synapses to a static configuration during testing, allowing for the assessment of the network's generalisation and stability.\n",
    "    Periodically store the SNN weights before switching to static synapses to preserve the learned information and facilitate analysis.\n",
    "    Document and discuss the impact of this intercalated training and testing approach on the SNN's performance, emphasising improvements achieved through supervised learning and the network's ability to generalise with static synapses.\n"
